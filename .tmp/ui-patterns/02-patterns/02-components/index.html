<div class="base--STYLED">
<p>Components are <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#components">self-contained interface items</a> that are used to view and/or interact with content. Navigation and search are examples of components. A combination of elements and components is used to create larger layouts. Components should adapt to <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html">available features</a> and their own size. Explore <a href="https://github.com/snugug/eq.js">eq.js</a> for more information about responsive components.</p>
