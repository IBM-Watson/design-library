<div class="base--STYLED">
<p>Welcome to the IBM Watson Design Guide’s Pattern Library!</p>
<p>The Pattern Library is a set of usable patterns expressed in HTML, Sass, and JavaScript, that can be used as a base for developing new or updating existing web projects, especially those that are powered by Watson.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The Pattern Library can be installed through <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ bower install watson-design-library --save
</code></pre>
<p>This will install the patterns, as well as its dependencies and the documentation from the rest of this site, into the project’s local <code>bower_components</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-the-pattern-library">Working with the Pattern Library</h2>
<p>Each pattern in the Pattern Library comes with HTML written in <a href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/">Swig</a> and self-contained Sass and JavaScript that can be brought in to a project as needed. While the Sass and JavaScript can be used across any web project, the HTML will likely need to be implemented on a project-by-project basis, depending on how HTML gets rendered for that project.</p>
<h3 id="styling-a-project">Styling a Project</h3>
<p>Styling for projects is done through <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>. No CSS files are included intentionally. The styling that is available is basic and will not fit all projects; teams should include designers and developers to flesh out the styling of a project. What <em>is</em> provided are a set of patterns that encapsulate the design guidelines presented within the Watson Design Guide that are customizable to a project’s needs within those guidelines.</p>
<p>All styling is written following our <a href="/guidelines/development/sass">Sass and CSS Development Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>The Pattern Library is best used when it is customized for the needs of a given project. <a href="/ui-patterns/documentation/settings">Settings</a> for customization are provided by <a href="https://github.com/at-import/toolkit">Toolkit</a>, so a project’s main Sass file should be set up as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">@import &quot;toolkit&quot;;

// Settings Go here

@import &quot;watson-design-library/patterns/watson-patterns&quot;;

// Custom project styling
</code></pre>
<p>Import paths vary based on their precise location in regards to the main Sass file. Imports should only be imported once; this can be accomplished using <a href="https://github.com/Compass/compass/tree/master/import-once">Compass Import Once</a> or <a href="https://github.com/at-import/node-sass-import-once">Node Sass Import Once</a>, amongst other tools.</p>
<p>Each pattern also includes an <em>Application Methods</em> section that will include the available mixins, extends, classes, and settings, as needed.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-interactivity">JavaScript Interactivity</h3>
<p>Some patterns will include JavaScript. When they do, the <em>Application Methods</em> section of a pattern will explain what files are needed (internally or as a 3rd party dependency) or if files can be ignored in favor of adding something else (for instance, including a <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> detect to a custom Modernizr build).</p>
<p>All JavaScript is written following our <a href="/guidelines/development/javascript">JavaScript Development Guidelines</a>.</p>
