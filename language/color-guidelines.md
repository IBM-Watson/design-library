## Color
Color is a crucial component of our visual vernacular, helping to unify the look and feel of all communications. The IBM Design core color system comprises a wide spectrum of colors; IBM Watson relies on a defined subset of those colors to establish its unique presence while respecting the broader IBM Design guidelines.

Primary: Blue 60, Secondary: Orange 50, Accent: Teal 40  
*Consider users who are sensitive to brightness and high contrast colors by using a neutral value as a background color instead of pure white.*
