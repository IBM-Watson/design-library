## Color
Color is a crucial component of our visual vernacular, helping to unify the look and feel of all communications. The IBM Design core color system comprises a wide spectrum of colors; IBM Watson relies on a defined subset of those colors to establish its unique presence while respecting the broader IBM Design guidelines.

### Choosing Your Color Palette
The IBM Watson color system consists of a set of primary colors and secondary colors, with additional supporting color values. The colors chosen for IBM Watson are flexible and distinguish Watson as a brand across all user experiences. Carefully choose colors that reinforce Watson's personality (link to personality) and set the tone of your product.

Choose a primary color, a secondary color, and an accent color. Use additional color values and neutrals from the IBM Design color palette as needed.

Color is a powerful communication tool to determine hierarchy on a page. Use ample white space and neutrals to create balance and to direct users' attention. Use tints and shades of your primary or secondary colors to unify your design. These values can add variety to your palette without additional colors. It is essential to understand color psychology to evoke desired feelings or moods from users. For example, while warm colors can impress a sense of energy, and cool colors can feel soothing.
