Motion is a fundamental element of user experience design because it demonstrates the emotional quality and vitality of the product. It gives non-verbal communication to the user and can be thought of as the product's body language. Within software, motion is conveyed through the process of animationâ€”"the illusion of movement through a sequence of images."

Motion design enhances communication throughout the design process, from the rapid prototyping of scenarios and interfaces to delivering final coded interface animations. The metaphor for animation comes from the IBM Design Language metaphor of elegant machine motion. The [IBM Design Language Motion section](http://pages.design.ibm.com/tremblay-us/ibm-watson-design-library/master/dist/animation.html) walks through the methodologies and process for creating animation for IBM software products.
