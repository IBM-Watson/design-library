Motion is a fundamental element of user experience design because it demonstrates the emotional quality and vitality of the product. It gives non-verbal communication to the user and is the body language of a product. Within software, motion is conveyed through the process of animationâ€”"the illusion of movement through a sequence of images."

Motion design enhances communication throughout the design process, from the rapid prototyping of scenarios and interfaces to delivering final coded interface animations. The metaphor for animation comes from the IBM Design Language metaphor of elegant machine motion. The IBM Design Language Motion Section walks through the methodologies and process for creating animation for IBM software products.


## Animation Library

The animations within this library are a collection of entrance and exit animations for page transitions that can be utilized within our interfaces. The library was built using CSS keyframe animations and can be implemented by using a Sass Mixin. To view more about how to use this library, take a look here, and please feel free to contribute additional animations.
